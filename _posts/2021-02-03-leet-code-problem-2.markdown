## LeetCode Problem 2 - Add Two Numbers

In this post we'll be talking about solving the second [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) problem.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a site that provides programming problems for practice. A lot of developers use it to hone their skills or to practice for upcoming interviews.
The questions available are used by large tech companies as interview questions, so it's a good place to start and the difficulty of the questions being Easy, Medium or Hard.

While the solutions for these problems are available directly from the site, they are directly to the point and can be a bit technical. I'd like to use these types of posts
to explain the thought process to get to the solution, and how to think about and test for edge cases. I'll be using C# in dotnet to create my solution.
