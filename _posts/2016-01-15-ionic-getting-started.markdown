# Ionic Framework
The [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is a front end framework 
used for making hybrid mobile applications. It helps you give your app a native
feel without all the work.

Ionic utilizes the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework to create single
page applications on top of the cordova hybrid platform.
