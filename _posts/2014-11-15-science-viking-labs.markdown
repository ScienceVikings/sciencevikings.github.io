Welcome to Science Viking Labs! We are a group of bearded men out to make life easier through automation.
We currently have a couple of projects in the planning phase and plan to use this blog to show our progress along 
the way. It'll also be where we talk about other interests and showcase experiments we do outside of normal projects.
So, in the mean time, grow a beard!
